# ```> Libft```
Project libft (or library 42) was meant to provide us with an understanding of
how we could develop our own library of tools. The requirements listed includes the use
of a Makefile to compile the archive .a file.

---
#### ```> To Execute compile the executable as follows:```
```bash
cc main.c libft.a -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o exec
```
The above will then tell the compilor to name the resulting executable file 'exec.'

#### ```Next steps```
Beyond the final project of the 42 common core several c related projects exist. In order to complete them I have optimized my Libft and added binary tree capabilities which allows me to store data in a similar way to that of the stl Map container in c++.
